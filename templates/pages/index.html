    <p class="mb-4">Put some secret information in the box above. Or even some boring non-secret information.
      The secret will be encrypted and stored.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">You will receive a link that allows you to retrieve the secret later.
      Send that link to whomever you want to share the secret with. As soon as
      somebody opens the link and retrieves the secret, the stored secret will
      be deleted.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Secrets will expire 24 hours after they were created.</p>

    <p class="mb-4"><b>Note:</b> The secrets are encrypted using XChaCha20-Poly1305 before being stored in the database. The encryption key is included in the URL you get, and not stored anywhere else. I don't
      store or log it, but you should decide for yourself whether
      you trust this service before using this for secrets you care about.</p>
